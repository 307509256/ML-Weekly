# ML-Weekly

My weekly of machine learning. It is actually a collection of my implementations of machine learning algorithms. We will also cover distributed-tensorflow and multi-GPU computing.

## Environments

It is based on `python3` and `jupyter notebook`. To initialize the environment, you need `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` firstly.

```
pyenv install 3.6.0
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 tf-lab
pyenv local tf-lab

# basic
pip install numpy tensorflow jupyter
# if spacemacs
pip install anaconda-mode
```

Some code may need tensorflow-gpu or other environments.

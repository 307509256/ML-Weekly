# ML-Weekly

My weekly of machine learning. It is actually a collection of my implementations of machine learning algorithms.

## Environments

It is based on `python3` and `jupyter notebook`. I use `pyenv` and `anaconda` to solve my environment. Other topics about environment is covered in P6-Misc.

```
pyenv install anaconda3-5.1.0

# install tensorflow
conda install tensorflow

# install sklearn
conda install scikit-learn

# install pytorch
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Some code may need tensorflow-gpu, opencv or other environments.

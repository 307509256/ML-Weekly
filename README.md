# ML-Weekly

My weekly of data-mining group. Try to implement some algorithms. Or distributed and multi-GPU computing.

## Environments

The repo is basically based on `python3`. It is essential to have

```
brew install python3-pip
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install jupyter
```

It is a good idea to use `jupyter notebook`. After installing it, type

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then have a look at `*.ipynb`.

## Topics

- [W1-Tensorflow-Started](W1-Tensorflow-Started), try to use simple `tensorflow`.
- [W2-Q-Learning-Algorithm](W2-Q-Learning-Algorithm), for simple q-learning algorithm with tabular representation when the number of state-action map is not so large.
- [W3-Reinforcement-Learning](W3-Reinforcement-Learning), realistic reinforcement learning algorithm with function approximators, especially neuron networks.

## Reference

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

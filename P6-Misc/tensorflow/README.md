# Tensorflow

Here we cover the usage of tensorflow.

## `basic.py`

A simple usage of tensorflow. You can use it to test the installation of `tensorflow` with only CPU support.

## `gpu-acc.py`

The calculation sample with GPU support. You can use it to test the installation and GPU performance. For details about how to compile `tensorflow` with GPU support, have a look at my blog [Compile Tensorflow with GPU Support on Fedora](https://jasonqsy.github.io/compile-tensorflow-with-gpu-support-on-fedora.html).

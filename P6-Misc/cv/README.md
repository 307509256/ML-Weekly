# Computer Vision

Here I cover some environments about computer vision.

## opencv

Opencv can be installed directly by

```bash
conda install -c menpo opencv
```

## MS-COCO

You may need `pycocotools` to use MS-COCO dataset.

```
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi
cd coco/PythonAPI
make
```

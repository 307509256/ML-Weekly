# Recurrent Neural Networks

This part covers recurrent neural networks (RNN) and LSTM model.


## Tutorial

- [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
- [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

## Project

A typical usage of RNN/LSTM is in Natural Language Processing. The previous tutorials show RNN's ability to mimic articles, translate and so on. I think a minimal project can be mimic Shakespear's poems.

The training set can be downloaded from

```
wget http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/shakespear.txt
```

The objective is to trains a RNN to write some Shakespear-style poems.
